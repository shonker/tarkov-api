# Tarkov API (PHP)

Theres no documentation with this, if BGS don't start banning I might improve it and provide documentation. To use this you must know how to include PHP packages into your library via composer, and then checkout bin/app for examples. A lot is hardcoded (like roubles and such) for my own use... Again if no bans are triggered I might generalise and improve this. For now it's for education purposes... Good luck.

- Requirement: PHP 7.3+
- Run: `composer install`
- copy `bin/creds.json.dist` to `bin/creds.json`
- Usage: `php ./bin/app` 

```
todo - improve session handline and storage
todo - everything else...
```
